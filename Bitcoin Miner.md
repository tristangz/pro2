##### Final Project

My project idea is to make a bitcoin miner.

##### Hardware/ Software

I will use a Raspberry Pi, with NOOBS as the software. 

##### Steps

I will download a Bitcoin wallet on my computer, then create a pool account, and create a workers account. 
I will then install the required files and start mining. I can monitor my mining speed and performance through the terminal. 

##### Risks and Challenges

The risk of running a bitcoin miner is the chance of hurting your computer. 
If you run a Bitcoin miner 24 hours a day, every day, it could hurt your computer because most computers aren’t meant to run a program for that long. 
However, for this project, I probably won’t have any risks, because I will not have my miner running all day. 
A challenge may be the size of the files that need to be downloaded, they might take a long time to fully download.
